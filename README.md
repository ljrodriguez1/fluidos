https://ljrodriguez1.github.io/fluidos/

A React implementation of [Pavel Dobryakov's WebGL Fluid Simulation](https://github.com/PavelDoGreat/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation) as a component, not only is it a fun simulation to play with but when tweaked the settings to be less resource intensive and lower resolution, the simulation can be a cool UI element you could add to something like a navbar or page background like this: https://btr.pm/projects/

# How it works

Not a rewrite of the original script but just a basic, easy to use React component that adds a `<script>` tag containing a modified version of the original when the component mounts, the script then hooks into a `<canvas>` component generated by React, then it renders the Fluid sim.

You can edit the simulation settings on line 28 of fluid-init.js [https://github.com/x8BitRain/react-webgl-fluid/blob/master/assets/js/fluid-init.js#L4](https://github.com/x8BitRain/react-webgl-fluid/blob/master/assets/js/fluid-init.js#L28)


# Main changes

The modifications to the original Fluid WebGL script are as follows:

- Removed code that initializes the control panel for changing the sim settings.
- Absolute paths to .png resources.
- Name of the canvas element the scripts hooks into from
`document.getElementsByTagName('canvas')[0];`
to
`document.getElementsByClassName('fluid-canvas')[0];`
- Altered sim configuration to be lower res and density, also background is white now.
- Inline style as a states so you can change the dimensions of the canvas on the fly with React.

## react-boilerplate

Build using a simple React boilerplate from Lewagon configured with:

- React, ReactDOM
- Webpack 4
- Babel with es2015 and react presets
- `.js` or `.jsx`
- main `application.scss` stylesheet is imported in `index.js` as a module to enjoy hot reloading

## Scripts

To start the local Webpack Dev Server (usually on port `8080`):

```bash
yarn start
```

To lint all JavaScript files in the `src` folder:

```bash
yarn lint
```

To build static HTML and JS files for production or whatever rly)))

```bash
webpack -p
```
